# Geomorphometrics

A Java library for producing geomorphometrics from digital elevation data.

The library is an example use of Grids (https://github.com/agdturner/agdt-java-generic-grids) - a Java library for 2D square celled spatial raster data processing. The library is designed to be capable of processing very large data sets on relatively modest computational resources

## Usages
1. The library has been used to generate geomorphometrics for a number of regions of the world including most recently glacial regions.

More example usages are wanted. If you use this library please add to this list.

## Code status and development roadmap
This code is actively being developed.
